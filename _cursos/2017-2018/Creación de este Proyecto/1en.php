<h1>Creation of this Project</h1>

<p>Since the IES Delgado Hern&aacute;ndez educational center, despite having its own website, it does not have a section where to document and publish all the activities and projects that are carried out each year.</p>
<p>In this way, this information lacks the dynamism, interactivity and interoperability offered by a web application.</p>
<p>Therefore, the idea of ​​carrying out said project arose, an opportunity provided by the professor of the Web Applications Implementation module (Mr. Domingo P&eacute;rez Duque).</p>
<p>The objective of this application is the implementation of a management system and control of the extracurricular activities of the center through a web application.</p>
<p>It is intended to help and facilitate the users of the platform the management and consultation of these activities. In addition, through it, the opinions of the interested parties will be recorded through the comment system introduced in the application.</p>
<p>Another important point in the objective is based on the fact that in its development we increase knowledge considerably and can at the same time acquire habit and ease in web development.</p>
<p>The development of this project has required a lot of time, effort and dedication.</p>
